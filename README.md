Welcome to Neo Runner

Neo Runner is an endless runner style game that I programmed utilizing the JavaScirpt library, Three.js. Coupling JavaScript, HTML, and CSS I was able to create this fun game.

Both of my JavaScript files are linked to my index.html file. In my main.js file I have the various required aspects needed to set up my Three.js scene. These include my camera, scene, renderer, and my lights. I also have my animate function which runs the animation function allowing my scene to be animated. This is done by a few Three.js methods. I also have a window resize function that resizes my renderer and camera depending on the window size. So if this is viewed on a mobile device it will update the projection matrix.  

When a player enters their name in the text box, they will be added to a database that will allow them to have their high scores stored and compete against any user who plays the game! 

The game slowly speeds up causing it to be harder and harder to play as you survive longer!
