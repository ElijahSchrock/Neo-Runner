Welcome to Neo Runner

Neo Runner is an endless runner style game that I programmed utilizing the JavaScirpt library, Three.js. Coupling JavaScript, HTML, and CSS I was able to create this fun game.

Both of my JavaScript files are linked to my index.html file. In my main.js file I have the various required aspects needed to set up my Three.js scene. These include my camera, scene, renderer, and my lights. I also have my animate function which runs the animation function allowing my scene to be animated. This is done by a few Three.js methods. I also have a window resize function that resizes my renderer and camera depending on the window size. So if this is viewed on a mobile device it will update the projection matrix.
